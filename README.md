# Etch-A-Sketch

Combination between an [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) and a [Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad) with vanilla JavaScript.

<u>Features</u>:

- set the size of the board between 2 and 100 boxes
- draw with black and random colors
- use the eraser
- clean the board
- reset the board

**[`Demo Here`](https://oliver-ard.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)ðŸ‘‹**

The hardest part of this project was how to create the grid layout for the board because you need to make a loop inside another loop and check the size of the board, at least this is the solution I found.

I also made a modal box for when you need to set the size for the board. This is extra.

<u>What I have practiced in this project?</u>

- loops
- intense DOM manipulation
- events handling
